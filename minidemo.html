So to correct that, we decided to use the opportunity to really get past the whole classroom barrier issue. So there was a course that was available, that had to be covered. It’s a foundational course. And it met basically four days a week. Monday, Wednesday, for one section, and Tuesday, Thursday, for the other. So four of us decided to teach it.' ],

And all four of us meet every Friday to discuss the course and how it’s progressing. So for the first time since I’ve been here, at least, we are forcing ourselves in a positive way to work together, come to a consistent language, you know, if there is any confusion, we work through the confusion, through communication. You know, basically using this course, this foundational course, as a way to really address, hopefully, other concerns, and even lack of trust within the program. And start to build on it.' ],

And trying to figure out who would teach it. Here’s an opportunity that we can really work together. Let’s do it. And there’s no point leaving anyone out of it. Especially since we have the time, and it’s not about -- you two team teach, and I’ll teach the other one. No. Let’s all invest in this. This is something that we’ve said is foundational. We should all be involved in it.' ],

And when it comes down to it, it\'s not about will I get what you have or who teaches the better lesson or your PowerPoint versus mine. it\'s about getting the students aligned and are they prepared? Do we have evidence of such? you\'re moving on. So it was a roundabout answer for that.' ],

And he said, "they\'re not doing their work, so I\'m just gonna call the teacher and tell him that it\'s not my fault, that it\'s their fault." And I\'m like, "No", and I told him point blank, "No, it\'s your fault." And he said, "How could it be my fault? They didn\'t do the work." I\'m like, "Did you call \'em? Did you communicate to them? Did you put pressure on them?" Did you say, "We gotta get this done? Did you do anything? Did you do your work?" And he said, "Oh no, I was waiting for them." And I was very blunt with him. I said, "So you\'re equally to blame. Until you see that, you\'ll never fully understand how a team works." I said, "It takes equal responsibility. it\'s not about having one leader. it\'s about everyone taking a leadership position and shifting, depending on what is needed."' ],

We may not agree on it. we\'re gonna to change it. we\'re gonna finagle it. we\'re gonna adjust it just so, and it\'s not gonna be set in stone.' ],

But you know what, they can\'t fault us for trying. And at least from the measures we\'ve been given so far, the students are learning.' ],

I think we decided, all four of us, were gonna teach it back in July, but then realized there\'s nothing we can do since we\'re all leaving and no one\'s gonna be back in town.
