[ '1 Mark', 'Mark teaches high school', new Date(2001,1,1), new Date(2004,1,1), 'I was a high school, middle school teacher for years.  I was very happy at that position. I saw where the current technology education curriculum was going and wasn’t happy with it. I wanted to move to a level where I had an impact on it. I started looking at grad school.' ],
[ '1 Mark', 'Mark in graduate school', new Date(2004,1,1), new Date(2009,1,1), 'I went into Ohio State and I studied technology education and STEM education as far as presenting the curriculum and multiple disciplines to improve the students education. It wasn’t so much saving a program as it was benefiting the constitutents and getting them prepared for what they needed to do.' ],
[ '1 Mark', 'Mark applied to Berea', new Date(2009,1,1), new Date(2009,1,1), 'I finished my grad work there and obviously applied for jobs at many places. Berea invited me down. They had an industrial focus, educational focus, and the mission of the college was exceptional.' ],
[ '1 Mark', 'TAD works on their 10-year self-study process', new Date(2003,1,1), new Date(2013,1,1), 'When I first came they just, they were in the process of finishing the self-study.  It was a 10 year process. I was here for the last 2, 3 years of that process. I was looking at the data they collected.  We were talking about future directions. During that time we have had changes in faculty, changes in course offerings. Based upon -- we changed the core curriculum, the number of classes required of all the students, that they had to take in addition to different expectations for different degrees, options, concentrations [that] students experience when they come through our program.' ],
[ '1 Mark', 'TAD has a position open for 3-4 years', new Date(2005,1,1), new Date(2009,1,1), 'I was replacing, I filled a position they were not able to fill 3 to 4 years prior. The person who retired was here 40 plus years here.' ],
[ '1 Mark', 'Lots of faculty turnover in 5 years', new Date(2005,1,1), new Date(2009,1,1), 'They had a person come in [to the department], they left, another person came in, they left.  I came in. There was a feeling of lack of commitment.  There was sort of a revolving door, so to speak. Since that time, we have had a couple other faculty come and go in other areas.' ],
[ '1 Mark', 'Start of the self-study', new Date(2003,1,1), new Date(2005,1,1), 'As far as inside the department -- [or what we now call a] program -- people were just teaching their courses. People talked, [asked] “what are you doing,” there was a lot of small conversations about what people were doing -- but nobody was getting down and talking about what they were doing in their classes, it just wasn’t happening.' ],
[ '1 Mark', 'Discussion about changing TAD\'s name', new Date(2011,1,1), new Date(2013,1,1), 'When we were finishing up the self-study, it was looking at reflectively what we have done. [We had thoughts like] “maybe we should update, change the curriculum, are we preparing our students?”  Towards the end of that self study, [we started asking questions like] “are we providing what our students need, should there be changes?” That is when the name change started.  Industrial Arts is an old name.  Not that it is a bad name but it is associated not necessarily with the highest line of our field.  At that time there was a lot of quality lost in the field. So let’s change the name, get something that reflects what we do better.' ],
[ '1 Mark', 'Discussion about changing TAD\'s name', new Date(2011,1,1), new Date(2013,1,1), '[What we have in common is that] We all design. [But] What you call design and what I call design is different. Then began the discussion of what it (design) actually was. During that same time we had people leave, new people come in, and people who had different [views on the] significance of design. And they would agree, oh yeah, I do design, you do design too [in terms of using the same word], but in application it would be night and day differences. So there was a lot of that, miscommunication going on. Over those years we finally got to the point of “clearly this is not working, we need to figure out -- we need to go through, and everyone maybe might not agree on the same page, but everyone else needs to know where everyone else is.” It has been a slow go over 5 years.  But it is getting there.' ],
[ '1 Mark', 'Disagreement on Maker culture', new Date(2014,2,7), new Date(2014,2,7), 'We had a meeting just last week.  Myself and another colleague just laid it out -- I wouldn’t say argued -- that person said something, I disagreed and he disagreed, and at the end we realized we agreed. [My colleague] said the makers movement was very good for our institution because of the complexity of the machines. I viscerally disagreed (big hand motion) because I think I have seen what things like this have done to kids. “Wonderful kits” of technology may be cheaper without teachers, but they are not a replacement for education.' ],
[ '1 Mark', 'Disagreement on Maker culture', new Date(2014,2,7), new Date(2014,2,7), 'We eventually got to that point.  “Oh, I agree with you, because I believe it is a more complex machine.” “You agree with me, it can be overly simplified.” “Oh yes of course they can do that, no, it is not. “' ],
[ '1 Mark', 'TAD\'s 10-year self-study process', new Date(2003,1,1), new Date(2013,1,1), 'It was a 10 year process.  It was basically summarizing data and reporting out, a lot of typing. We were hoping that when we did the curriculum and everything that the changes would have already happened by now.  But there were so many other things going on, it was really hard to get a foundation because there were so many things changing.' ],
[ '1 Mark', 'High faculty turnover in past 5 years', new Date(2005,1,1), new Date(2009,1,1), 'We have 3 faculty left since I come here. And two faculty have come since I have been here and not including myself. When I came, two left, one came, one left, two came and not in that order.  3 have come, two have come in that 5 year period. It’s been a year or two, it looks like we have a group, let’s continue.' ],
[ '2 Mark', 'New TAD hire', new Date(2014,5,1), new Date(2014,8,1), 'We hired someone new for the program, that is partially TAD and partially ART. And during that process, some things that were underlined between, you know, faculty members of all ranks, came to the forefront. So even though the hire went on just fine, and we ended up hiring someone that should be a pretty good fit for the campus, it exposed some underlying things that were not being addressed. So during the summer, we experimented with some mediation, we had people assigned by the college to come in and talk to us, and talk about missions and goals, and even individually, things -- how we reflect on the program, and the pros and cons of certain relationships. And even issues between certain relationships. Areas of concern. A lot of it centered around lack of communication, lack of clear communication.' ],
[ '2 Mark', 'Lost a faculty member over the summer', new Date(2014,5,1), new Date(2014,8,1), 'During the summer, we lost a faculty member. We had one that left. So to correct that, we decided to use the opportunity to really get past the whole classroom barrier issue. So there was a course that was available, that had to be covered. It’s a foundational course. And it met basically four days a week. Monday, Wednesday, for one section, and Tuesday, Thursday, for the other. So four of us decided to teach it.' ],
[ '2 Mark', 'Currently team-teaching a course', new Date(2014,8,1), new Date(2014,12,1), 'So two of us are team teaching the Monday-Wednesday, and two were team teaching the Tuesday-Thursday. And all four of us meet every Friday to discuss the course and how it’s progressing. So for the first time since I’ve been here, at least, we are forcing ourselves in a positive way to work together, come to a consistent language, you know, if there is any confusion, we work through the confusion, through communication. You know, basically using this course, this foundational course, as a way to really address, hopefully, other concerns, and even lack of trust within the program. And start to build on it.' ],
[ '2 Mark', 'Deciding to team-teach the course', new Date(2014,5,1), new Date(2014,8,1), 'It came from the discussion -- it’s like we were free, we looked at our schedules, and two of us -- we all had free times. And trying to figure out who would teach it. Here’s an opportunity that we can really work together. Let’s do it. And there’s no point leaving anyone out of it. Especially since we have the time, and it’s not about -- you two team teach, and I’ll teach the other one. No. Let’s all invest in this. This is something that we’ve said is foundational. We should all be involved in it.' ],
[ '2 Mark', 'Realizing different definitions of design', new Date(2014,5,1), new Date(2014,8,1), 'I think it did come out when we were talking about it. And I don’t know if anyone would identify the same way that I did, but one of the things we realized -- and Matt made a good point of it, and I think we recognize those discussions -- is he thought about design from primarily an early consideration… Oh, how to put it? I want to say… Design for the sake of design. Design in the early form… I cannot think of the… Design for creativity, versus design for production.' ],
[ '2 Mark', 'Discussing design definitions over the summer', new Date(2014,5,1), new Date(2014,8,1), 'And I think there’s also -- the class that we’re teaching now -- it was brought up like ART -- we’re going to teach the design process. And the question was: which one? That led to a discussion -- when we talk about design, yeah, we all agree upon a very basic definition of -- you’ve got to do research, think, problem solve, evaluate, and all this other very common popular language.' ],
[ '2 Mark', 'Ongoing course meetings', new Date(2014,8,1), new Date(2014,12,1), 'And that’s something that even comes up now. We meet every Friday, to talk about how the classes went, but we also look into the future, and say -- so we want to do these activities. What’s the point of it? All because of this. Does that match what we’re trying to emphasize in this course? Yes or no. How can we finagle it? What should we be doing? We talk about the specific elements we want to address, and we try to work it back in. This is what we want to do. How do we achieve it?' ],
[ '2 Mark', 'Mark visits the other course section', new Date(2014,8,1), new Date(2014,12,1), 'So what I’ve done pretty regularly is -- I’m free in the afternoon, during both classes. Monday-Wednesday and Tuesday-Thursday, except obviously when I’m teaching the class. So the days I’m free for the other class, I tend to stop in if I’m curious or unsure how I would approach the content. Or -- how we talk about it. We’re going to implement in this way. I say -- well, I kind of want to see how they did it.' ],
[ '2 Mark', 'Mark brings feedback between course sections', new Date(2014,8,1), new Date(2014,12,1), 'And I may not do it the exact same way. But at least I know how they were exposed, so I know how to implement it the next day to my students with the other person I’m teaching with so we can address that.' ],
[ '2 Mark', 'First 2 weeks of team-teaching', new Date(2014,8,1), new Date(2014,8,15), 'Just starting… Well, it’s technically -- we had a half week and we had a full week. This is our second full week that just started. So yeah, we’re just getting into it. But we’ve been meeting… We started working on this basically in the second week of August. So we’ve been meeting a couple times, trying to get ramped up.' ],
[ '2 Mark', 'Busy semester schedule', new Date(2014,8,1), new Date(2014,12,1), 'I was amazed how full my day is now. Basically from 7:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. or 5:30. It’s full go. This is just a reality. It’s stressful, it’s tiring, but it’s been -- so far, at least for me, I think it’s been hugely positive and a great experience. Because now I feel -- it feels much easier to have conversations about things, because you’re not asking questions to, you know, about somebody else’s class. You’re asking questions about -- oh, for the learning of the students.' ],
[ '2 Mark', 'Mark has a personal realization over the summer', new Date(2014,5,1), new Date(2014,8,1), 'And I went to a summer institute in July. About leadership. And it’s something I realized -- my own thing -- just because I can take constructive criticism and because of the thick skin I have doesn’t mean other people have to or it’s fair that they should.' ],
[ '2 Mark', 'Mark\'s design course in spring 2014', new Date(2014,1,1), new Date(2014,5,1), 'I can say from my own experience in the spring -- I had an advanced course, where I asked the students to do a full experimental design. And two groups. So gave them a series of -- not necessarily problems, but situational-based considerations. And they had to not only look at those situations, but basically design a full research study. A small one, by comparison to other ones. Based upon the considerations. And then test it as best as they could. Or at least establish enough background data so they fully understood it and they can report on it. I left it up to the students to go through that process. They struggled. They had a hard time with it, because I didn’t tell them how to do it. I told them what the expectation was. This was an advanced course, so I expected them to struggle. They had to own it. And at the end of the course, they said this was hard, and it was challenging to them, and many times they were pissed off, for lack of a better word, but in the end, they really understood it, and they really understood why, and they found it invaluable. And even one student told me -- “now I can do anything.”' ],
[ '2 Mark', 'Student asks to change the major name', new Date(2014,9,1), new Date(2014,9,1), 'We really recently just had a student come to us, asking us to change the name of the major, the name of the program, because the student feels it doesn’t communicate well to industry. And the student apparently had some conversations, and he claims 30 students that are currently enrolled, and I said -- okay. That seems like a lot. And I think he’s exaggerating. But he said a lot of them went to go get jobs and couldn’t get jobs because the name of the major does not communicate well.' ],
[ '2 Mark', 'TAD reaches out to local industries', new Date(2013,1,1), new Date(2015,1,1), 'We are reaching out to local industries of various types, to collect more information regarding the future of our curriculum. Where things should be going. The preparation of our students. Names, changes, et cetera. As well -- and of course in addition to that, we’re looking at ways to better empower our students, once we leave here, to go out and be successful.' ],
[ '2 Mark', 'Mark has a personal epiphany', new Date(2014,5,1), new Date(2014,8,1), 'And that was something I found out, and this was something that -- it was definitely a personal epiphany on many levels. I have certain ways of doing things and I have a certain personality. That doesn’t mean that has to change. It’s part of who I am. But even with that, I need to be more receptive, even as an individual, of other people’s personalities, and their strengths and their weaknesses, and make sure that just because this works for me, and I am very much aggressive and I am very much follow through and get it done kind of mentality -- that can be very alienating for others. And that’s exactly what we don’t want to have.' ],
[ '2 Mark', 'Mark unable to discuss his realization with colleagues', new Date(2014,5,1), new Date(2014,8,1), 'I know Matt had an opportunity to share some of his things, something that he’s kind of come to the… A self-identification. Maybe even a resolution on. And I, less so… Have not been able to. And I think that might help, if I could. I just don’t know if we’re at a point where we could have that discussion. At least, not yet. I don’t necessarily see the benefit yet. I’d rather -- this is just my personal preference -- me sharing that information, I don’t see it as a negative or a positive. I see the best thing I can do for my stance is to enact it. So to be a good example of it. And maybe -- yeah, maybe it would be better if I communicated that.' ],
[ '3 Mark', 'Mark jokes about work being difficult', new Date(2014,8,1), new Date(2014,8,1), 'It\'s interesting, thinking back on certain pages of life, and I joked at my wife this weekend. I\'m like, \"This is the hardest relationship I\'ve been in.\" And I even joked with her and I said, \"If it wasn\'t for the fact this was my job, I probably would have dumped her.\" And just kidding aside, just because of the difficulty, but this is what you do. This is what we are trying to do, obviously for the benefit of our students, not for ourselves. So, a little bit of hardship goes a long way. At least that\'s what I\'m hoping.' ],
[ '3 Mark', 'TAD new hires', new Date(2014,5,1), new Date(2014,8,1), 'Technically, Matt is a third or half hire and then we have a new hire, Daniel, who was a half hire. So, between the two of \'em we have a person...' ]
